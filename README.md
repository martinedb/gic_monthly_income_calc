## Walkthrough of the Code

Below is a section-by-section guide to help you understand and adapt the script:

### 1. Input Variables

Set your GIC details here:
- **Principal:** The amount you invest.
- **Interest Rate:** The annual interest rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
- **Term:** The number of years the GIC lasts.

Edit these values to match your investment.

```python
principal = 10000   # Your GIC amount
interest_rate = 0.05 # Annual interest rate (5%)
term_years = 1       # Term in years
```

### 2. Monthly Income Calculation

Calculates your monthly income:

```python
monthly_income = (principal * interest_rate) / 12
```

The script may account for compounding if applicable.

### 3. Output

Prints your estimated monthly income:

```python
print(f"Estimated monthly income: ${monthly_income:.2f}")
```

## Customizing for Your Needs

- **Adjust the input variables** for your principal, rate, and term.
- **Expand the script:** Add more GICs or change the compounding frequency as needed.

---

## Example Use Case

Suppose you invest $20,000 at a 4% annual rate for 2 years:

```python
principal = 20000
interest_rate = 0.04
term_years = 2
```

Run the script to see your monthly income.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- Check that variable values are numbers.
- Review the calculation logic if results look off.
